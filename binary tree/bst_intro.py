#  the data of all the nodes in the left sub-tree of the root node should be less than the data of the root. 
#  The data of all the nodes in the right subtree of the root node should be greater 
#  than equal to the data of the root. As a result, the leaves on the farthest 
#  left of the tree have the lowest values, whereas the leaves on the right of the tree have the greatest values.
